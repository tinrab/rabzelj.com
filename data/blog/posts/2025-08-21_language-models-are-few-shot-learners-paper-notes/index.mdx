Introduces GPT-3, a 175-billion parameter autoregressive language model, and evaluates its performance on various NLP tasks.
Shows that large transformer models exhibit good few-shot and zero-shot learning.

# In-context learning

The model learns to perform a task at inference time based on the info provided in the prompt.
No weights are updated.

They explore three settings for this:
- Few-shot: The model is given a small number of examples (typically 10 to 100) to learn from at inference time.
- One-shot: The model is given only one example.
- Zero-shot: The model is given only a natural language description of the task.

The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and zero-shot is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.
This way we communicate the desired format for the output.

# Architecture

The architecture is the same as GPT-2, with minimal changes.
They focused on scale rather than novel components.

It uses same key features as GPT-2, including pre-normalization (applying layer normalization before the attention and feed-forward sub-layers for better training stability) and a modified initialization scheme.

It also incorporates alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in its layers.
This is similar to the approach used in the "Sparse Transformer."
In "sparse" attention, each token only attends to a limited, predefined subset of other tokens.
The model can be computationally efficient without sacrificing too much performance, which is important for a model of this size.

They've trained several sizes, the largest one is called GPT-3 (175B parameters).

# Dataset

The primary source was CommonCrawl dataset.
To improve its quality, they augmented the data with several other more curated datasets:
- An expanded version of the WebText dataset, which is a collection of text from outbound links on Reddit.
- Two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2).
- The English-language Wikipedia.

During training, the model didn't sample from these datasets proportionally to their size.
The higher-quality datasets like Wikipedia and the books corpora were "up-weighted," meaning the model was trained on them more frequently to improve its overall performance.

They've built a classifier model to distinguish between high and low quality documents.
The classifier was trained on their WebText dataset as a positive example of high quality text and CommonCrawl as a negative example.

They used fuzzy deduplication to reduce redundancy and prevent the model from overfitting on repated content.
This removed documents that were highly similar.

There was some train-test overlap, "data contamination," in the datasets.
This is to be expected with huge text datasets.
They've tried removing overlaps, but they report that a bug in their filtering process meant that some of these overlaps were not successfully removed, and the immense cost of training prevented them from retraining.

After a post-training analysis, they found that performance difference was negligible.
