This paper contains a lot of info and an overview of the entire field.
The paper can be looked at as a survey.

It proposes a unified text-to-text framework that transforms all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format.
A single model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process can be applied on a diverse set of NLP tasks.

They introduce a new cleaned dataset called C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus).
"Many of the scraped pages contained warnings stating that Javascript should be enabled so we removed any line with the word Javascript." Lmao.

They systematically tested different approaches to scaling.
"You were just given 4x more compute. How should you use it?"
Different architectures, training objectives, datasets, and scaling strategies.

Key findings:
- Encoder-decoder architecture works best for the text-to-text approach (vs decoder-only models).
- Denoising objectives beat language modeling for pre-training (corrupting text and having the model reconstruct it).
- Scale is good, bigger models and more data consistently help.
- Multi-task pre-training can work but isn't clearly better than the standard pre-train then fine-tune approach.

They use "sentinel tokens" when corrupting text.
Each consecutive span of tokens is replaced by a sentinel token (e.g. &lt;X&gt; and &lt;Y&gt;) that is unique over the example.

Example:

Original:
```
Thank you [for inviting] me to your party [last] week.
```

Inputs:
```
Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week.
```

Targets:
```
<X> for inviting <Y> last <Z>
```

They do this for efficiency.
The sentinel tokens create a clear mapping between what was removed and what needs to be reconstructed.
Instead of predicting every single token in the original sequence, you only predict the corrupted parts. This makes training faster.
The model learns to reconstruct meaningful chunks of text, not just individual words.

HPO on large language models is tough.
They do hyperparameter searches on smaller models (like T5-Small).
They train these smaller models for a fraction of the total time and find the optimal learning rate, warmup steps, weight decay, etc., at that scale.
The assumption is that hyperparameters that work well on a smaller model will be a very good starting point for the larger model.

They use a "coordinate ascent" approach.
They're not looking for the best model, dataset, and objective all at once, they do a baseline and then alter one aspect at a time.
For example, they keep the objective and data fixed and only compare different model architectures, and they use the best architecture from the previous step and only compare different pre-training objectives.
This systematic one-variable-at-a-time exploration is much more manageable than a combinatorial search.
The model is also similar to BERT, so they use similar parameters as a starting point.

They use AdaFactor optimizer, which is supposed to be more memory-efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter choices.
It often works well without LR tuning.

They watch the training loss curves.
If the loss explodes or plateaus unexpectedly, they might manually intervene by stopping the training, lowering the learning rate, and resuming from a recent checkpoint.
"We use a constant learning rate of $0.001$ when fine-tuning. We save a checkpoint every $5,000$ steps and report results on the model checkpoint corresponding to the highest validation performance."
