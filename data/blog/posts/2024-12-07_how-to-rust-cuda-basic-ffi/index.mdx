There are existing crates for working with CUDA in Rust, but let's see how to get up and running using only [cc](https://crates.io/crates/cc) and rolling our own bindings.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinrab/rust-cuda-demo).
This post contains only excerpts.

# Setup

You need CUDA Toolkit installed on your system along with any additional libraries you might need.
I use Arch (by the way) which has a wiki page about installing [CUDA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GPGPU#CUDA).

We'll use [cc](https://crates.io/crates/cc) to run the CUDA compiler (nvcc) and link the libraries.

```toml { "fileName": "Cargo.toml" }
[build-dependencies]
cc = "1.2.2"
```

The CUDA compiler (nvcc) requires a specific version of GCC. In this case, we use GCC 13, which must be in your system's PATH.

```rust { "fileName": "build.rs" }
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    cc::Build::new()
        .cuda(true)
        .cudart("static")
        .includes(&["./cuda", "/opt/cuda/include"])
        .files(&[
            "./cuda/lib.cu",
            "./cuda/lib_math.cu",
            "./cuda/lib_cublas.cu",
        ])
        // Needed because nvcc requires specific gcc version.
        .flag("-ccbin=gcc-13")
        .warnings(false)
        .extra_warnings(false)
        .compile("rustcudademo");

    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native=/opt/cuda/lib");

    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=cuda");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=cudart");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=cublas");

    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={}", "./build.rs");
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={}", "./cuda");

    Ok(())
}
```

Static linking is also possible if you plan to distribute binaries.

This build script isn't platform-independent. As an improvement, we could introduce conditional compilation and smarter path detection for include paths.

# Memory management

When working with CUDA, memory can be allocated on the host (CPU & RAM) or the device (GPU).
Typical workflow involves allocating memory on the host, copying it to the device, running the kernel, copying the result back to the host, and deallocating everything.
We want to avoid copying data back and forth as much as possible.

We will manage memory in Rust via RAII, and allocate on the device manually in C++.
The FFI interface (from Rust to C++) will accept memory pointers that remain valid throughout the duration of CUDA operations.

Sometimes we want to allocate memory in Rust, pass it to C++, and forget about it.
The lifetime therefore outlives the scope of the Rust function calling C++ functions.
This can be achieved by using [Box::leak](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.leak).
We would then need to free the memory manually in C++.

We could expose CUDA memory allocation functions to Rust directly.
Although, keeping CUDA-specific things in C++ makes everything clearer.
Especially if you're looking for learning resources, which are all written in C++.

The code for launching kernels should (probably) also remain in C++.
The CUDA compiler (nvcc) is a compiler driver on top of host compiler (gcc).
One feature that it adds is the triple chevron syntax `<<<...>>>` for launching kernels.
Doing that in Rust wouldn't be straightforward, so we would need to call `cudaLaunchKernel` directly.
That is more cumbersome.

The possibilities are endless, and you'll need to evaluate the tradeoffs for your specific use case.

# FFI

Let's start with a simple example of adding two vectors.

First, we declare the FFI in C/C++.

```cpp { "fileName": "cuda/lib_math.h" }
#ifndef LIB_MATH_H
#define LIB_MATH_H

#include <cuda_runtime.h>

extern "C" {
    cudaError_t math_vector_add(
        int n,
        const float* a,
        const float* b,
        float* c
    );
}

#endif // LIB_MATH_H
```

Then we declare the FFI in Rust.
These rarely look nice.

```rust { "fileName": "src/math.rs" }
pub mod ffi {
    use super::*;

    type CudaErrorType = c_int;

    #[link(name = "rustcudademo", kind = "static")]
    extern "C" {
        pub fn math_vector_add(
            n: c_int,
            a: *const f32,
            b: *const f32,
            c: *mut f32,
        ) -> CudaErrorType;
    }
}
```

Finally, we implement a safe API in Rust.

```rust { "fileName": "src/math.rs" }
pub fn vector_add(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> CudaResult<Vec<f32>> {
    let mut c = vec![0.0; a.len()];
    unsafe {
        handle_cuda_error!(ffi::math_vector_add(
            a.len() as c_int,
            a.as_ptr(),
            b.as_ptr(),
            c.as_mut_ptr()
        ))?;
    }
    Ok(c)
}
```

Sometimes it's good to further check or assert parameters and return an appropriate error.

# Better types and semantics

C/C++ often does not provide the APIs we would prefer to work with in any reasonable capacity.

Consider this [example](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__DEVICE.html#group__CUDART__DEVICE_1g80861db2ce7c29b6e8055af8ae01bc78).

```cpp
cudaError_t cudaGetDevice(int *device);
```

Using a pointer as a parameter that the function will mutate and an enum return type (integer) feels wrong.
C/C++ doesn't have a result monad, nor expressive pattern matching.
This function always returns an "error", which is `cudaSuccess` (`0`) on success.

So then the question is, how to expose this in Rust?
That's up to us.

```rust { "fileName": "src/cuda.rs" }
pub mod ffi {
    use std::ffi::c_int;

    type CudaErrorType = c_int;

    #[link(name = "rustcudademo", kind = "static")]
    extern "C" {
        /// Returns which device is currently being used.
        #[link_name = "cudaGetDevice"]
        pub fn cuda_get_device(device: &mut c_int) -> CudaErrorType;

        /// Returns the description string for an error code.
        #[link_name = "cudaGetErrorString"]
        pub fn cuda_get_error_string(code: c_int) -> *const c_char;
    }

    // ...
}

pub fn get_device_count() -> CudaResult<u32> {
    let mut count = 0;
    unsafe {
        handle_cuda_error!(ffi::cuda_get_device_count(&mut count))?;
    }
    Ok(count as u32)
}
```

Here we wrote a safe wrapper `get_device_count` around the FFI function that returns a `Result`.

# cuBLAS

Let's also try using cuBLAS.

```cpp { "fileName": "cuda/lib_cublas.h" }
#ifndef LIB_CUBLAS_H
#define LIB_CUBLAS_H

#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

extern "C" {
    cudaError_t cublas_sgemm(
        int n,
        const float* a,
        const float* b,
        float* c,
        float alpha,
        float beta,
        cublasStatus_t* cublas_status
    );
}

#endif // LIB_CUBLAS_H
```

Declare the FFI.

```rust { "fileName": "src/cublas.rs" }
#[link(name = "rustcudademo", kind = "static")]
extern "C" {
    pub fn cublas_sgemm(
        n: c_int,
        a_matrix: *const f32,
        b_matrix: *const f32,
        c_matrix: *mut f32,
        alpha: f32,
        beta: f32,
        cublas_status: *mut CublasStatusType,
    ) -> CudaErrorType;
    // ...
}
```

Write a safe wrapper for the function.

```rust
pub fn sgemm(n: usize, a: &[f32], b: &[f32], alpha: f32, beta: f32) -> CudaResult<Vec<f32>> {
    let mut c = vec![0.0; n * n];
    unsafe {
        let mut cublas_status = 0;
        handle_cublas_error!(
            ffi::cublas_sgemm(
                n as c_int,
                a.as_ptr(),
                b.as_ptr(),
                c.as_mut_ptr(),
                alpha,
                beta,
                &mut cublas_status,
            ),
            cublas_status
        )?;
    }
    Ok(c)
}
```

Then we can use it, without any `unsafe` blocks.

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    let a = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
    let b = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
    let c = sgemm(2, &a, &b, 1.0, 0.0).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(c, vec![7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 22.0]);
}
```

# Conclusion

Working with CUDA in Rust involves three key steps: linking libraries, declaring FFIs, and writing safe wrappers around them.
Several existing crates provide APIs for CUDA, and there are also ways to auto-generate FFI bindings.
That's something to look into.
