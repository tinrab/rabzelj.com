Next.js can be built in "standalone" mode, where all the files needed for running an app in production are built and moved into `.next/standalone` directory.
After doing just that, I had trouble getting [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) to work, which is used by Next.js for image optimization.
There's even a log messages warning you that [Sharp is missing in production](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sharp-missing-in-production).

Simply trying to install sharp, locally and for CI on GitHub Actions, has lead me down a rabbit hole.
From following Vercel's official [Next.js in Docker example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker),
which [is incorrect](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/35296#discussioncomment-4250539) (they automatically install _sharp_ for you on their platform),
trying to get libvips to compile,
trying different Docker base images and different libraries, glibc and musl,
skimming tons of GitHub issues and discussions, rewriting my Dockerfile 5 times...

Long story short, here's the partial Dockerfile for my current working solution.
This is for my pnpm/turborepo-based monorepo.
To be fair, my actual Dockerfile is bigger, which is at least partially the reason why I was struggling.

```docker
FROM node:20.10-bullseye-slim as base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /workspace

# This is necessary to run sharp
RUN npm install -g --arch=x64 --platform=linux --libc=glibc sharp@0.33.0-rc.2
# Other dependencies...

# Production image, copy all the files and run Next.js
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /workspace

ENV NODE_ENV production
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
# Path to global installation of sharp
ENV NEXT_SHARP_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules/sharp

# Copy dependencies
COPY --from=deps --chown=nextjs:nodejs /usr/local/lib/node_modules/sharp /usr/local/lib/node_modules/sharp

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Set the correct permission for prerender cache
RUN mkdir .next && \
    chown nextjs:nodejs .next && \
    mkdir -p ./apps/site/.next && \
    chown nextjs:nodejs ./apps/site/.next

# Copy Next.js built artifacts
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs ./apps/site/.next/standalone ./
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs ./apps/site/.next/static ./.next/static
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs ./apps/site/.next/static ./apps/site/.next/static
# Include public directory
COPY ./apps/site/public ./apps/site/public

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000
# Set hostname to localhost
ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"
# Run the app
CMD ["node", "apps/site/server.js"]
```

The first change was to use `sharp@next`, a pre-release version of sharp ([Enhancement: Major overhaul of installation](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/3750)).
This made it easier to build on GitHub Actions.
Weirdly, it works without needing to install any extra dependencies on the action's Ubuntu-based runner.

I used to write giant Dockerfiles that build the entire project inside a container, but not doing that anymore.
Creating Docker images is generally easier by building the project on the host or CI server (had pretty good experience with building and publishing using GitHub Actions), then copying artifacts to the image.
Installing all the dependencies inside a Dockerfile is tedious, and I prefer to avoid it.

I had to install _sharp_ globally.
Because of how pnpm works, it requires you to install sharp manually (see [this](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/8310#issuecomment-1702967398) and [this](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/errors/missing-sharp/)).
That didn't work for me, so I installed it with npm and copied it to the production stage from `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`.

All of this seems to work, for now.
